          I have always dreamed of creating impactful web applications, and the
          Harvard CS50P course ignited my passion for development. This
          Python-based course, followed by the CS50X course in C language, gave
          me a strong foundation in programming principles and memory
          management, which later enhanced my understanding of JavaScript and
          modern web technologies.

          My journey continued with The Odin Project, where I expanded my
          front-end skills and developed a strong grasp of FlexBox and Grid.
          Working in CSS has become a source of satisfaction, especially as Iâ€™ve
          honed my expertise in React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Today, I am
          skilled in using modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries to create
          efficient, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
